# Array-Operations-Tool-Java
We are creating a java program that performs various operations on a 1D array based on user input.
The Array Operation Tool is a Java-based console application that allows users to perform various operations on an integer array. The tool provides a user-friendly menu to add, delete, search, reverse, sort, and display array elements, making it a great utility for practicing array manipulations and improving programming skills.

Features:

    Add an element at a specific position.
    Delete an element at a specific position.
    Search for an element in the array.
    Reverse the array.
    Sort the array (ascending or descending).

Bonus Features:

    Allow the user to save the modified array to a file.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Java

Development Environment: Any IDE or text editor that supports Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code).


Key Functions:

addElement:

Adds an element to a specified position in the array.

Resizes the array dynamically.

deleteElement:

Removes an element from a specified position in the array.

Resizes the array dynamically.

searchElement:

Searches for a specific element in the array.

Returns the position of the element if found.

reverseArray:

Reverses the array in place.

sortArray:

Sorts the array in ascending or descending order based on user input.
